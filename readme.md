# Introduction
This is a VST effect that emulates EAX (Environmental Audio Extensions) reverb. EAX was a standard used in late 90s to early 2000s Creative Labs sound cards to add audio effects to games. Some modern sound cards such as Realtek HD Audio can emulate EAX. This VST is based on the [openal-soft](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft) EAX Reverb Implementation which was [ported to c++](https://github.com/Relfos/EAXReverb).
